# Setting Up a React Application using npx ‚Äì Key Notes

## 1. Prerequisites Recap

- **Ensure Node.js is installed**, as it is required for React development.
- **Node.js is used to:**
  - Run a development server for React apps.
  - Convert React code into vanilla JavaScript for browsers.
  - Manage dependencies via **npm (Node Package Manager)**.
- **npm allows for:**
  - Installing and uninstalling packages.
  - Running a development server.
  - Creating and destroying React applications.
- **npx is bundled with npm** and is used to execute Node packages without installing them globally.

## 2. Setting Up a React App

### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository**
- Navigate to **GitHub** and **create a new repository**.
- Name the repository (e.g., `react`).
- This repository will be used for storing the project.

### **Step 2: Open the Repository Workspace**
- Once the repository is created, **open it in the workspace**.

### **Step 3: Run the Command to Create a React App**
- Open the **terminal** and run:
  ```sh
  npx create-react-app my-app --use-npm
  ``` 
# **This command:**
- **Creates** a new React app inside the `my-app` folder.
- **Installs** all necessary dependencies in the `node_modules` folder.

---

# **3. Running the React App**

## **Step 1: Change into the Project Directory**
- **Navigate into the newly created project folder by running:**

  ```sh
  cd my-app
  ``` 
- **Start the development server:**

  ```
  npm start
  ```
- **This launches the React app, making it ready for development**

# **4. Benefits of `create-react-app`**
- Provides all necessary boilerplate code for a React project.
- Developers can start quickly and remove unnecessary parts later.
- Uses npm as the package manager (default is Yarn, but `--use-npm` ensures npm is used).

# **5. Summary**
- **Node.js & npm** are crucial for React development.
- **npx create-react-app** sets up a React project with minimal effort.
- **npm start** runs the development server.
- The next step is learning about **React Developer Tools** for debugging.

# React Developer Tools - Summary Notes
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to React Developer Tools
- A **Chrome Extension** for inspecting and debugging React applications.
- Helps view **React components, props, and state**.
- Similar to Chrome DevTools but specifically for **React apps**.
- Useful for testing **changes, debugging errors, and optimizing performance**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installing React Developer Tools
- **Search for "React Developer Tools"** in the Chrome Web Store.
- Click **"Add to Chrome"** and **pin it to the toolbar** for quick access.
- May require **restarting Chrome** after installation.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Why Use React Developer Tools?
- Lets you inspect **React components**, not just the HTML output.
- Identifies if a site uses React:
- - **Blue icon** = Production build (optimized).
- - **Orange icon** = Development build (unoptimized).
- Helps **debug component props and state** in real-time.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Using React Developer Tools
- The **Components tab** shows:
- - React elements and their **props (properties)**.
- - How components are structured in the app.
- The **Element Picker** lets you:
- - Select components directly from the page.
- - View **props and state** of selected components.
- On complex sites (e.g., **Twitter**), component names may be minified in production mode.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Debugging Features
- **Highlight updates when components render:**
- - Shows when components re-render using **visual highlights**.
- - Helps find **unnecessary re-renders** that may slow the app.
- **Profiler tab** (for advanced users):
- - **Measures render time** for components.
- - Helps **optimize slow components**.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways
- React Developer Tools work alongside **Chrome DevTools** for debugging React apps.
- Useful for **inspecting props, debugging performance, and optimizing rendering**.
- Future lessons will cover building React components and adding interactivity.

# React Components - Summary Notes
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Recap of Lesson 1
- Learned what React is and its benefits.
- Understood how a React application works.
- Created a React app from scratch using `npx create-react-app`.
- 
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to React Components
- React apps are made up of **components**.
- Components can be **functional (stateless)** or **class-based (stateful)**.
- React **hooks** allow functional components to manage state and behave like class components.
  
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Components in React
**A) Functional (Stateless) Components**
- A *JavaScript function* that returns JSX (React‚Äôs HTML-like syntax).
- Uses *props* (properties) to customize output.
- Example:
``` js
  function FunctionalGreeting(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
  }
```
- Once rendered, functional components do not change unless their props update.
Best for static UI elements that don‚Äôt need interactivity.

**B) Class (Stateful) Components**
- Uses state to store dynamic values.
- Can change over time, unlike functional components.
- - Example:
``` js
  class StatefulGreeting extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  setCount = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
        <button onClick={this.setCount}>Increase</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
- Best for ***components that need interactivity*** (eg, buttons, forms, counters).

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Props vs. State
| Feature           | Functional Component (Props)  | Class Component (State)  |
|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Data Type**    | Passed in as properties     | Stored internally        |
| **Changeable?**  | ‚ùå No (static)              | ‚úÖ Yes (dynamic)         |
| **Best For**     | Displaying static content   | Interactive UI elements  |

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ React Hooks: The Modern Alternative
- **Hooks let functional components use state, like class components.**
- `useState` is the most common hook:
```js
  import { useState } from "react";

  function HooksCounter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
```

- **Advantages of Hooks over Class Components:**
- - **Less code** ‚Üí No need for a constructor or this keyword.
- - **Easier to manage state** in simple functions.
- - **Becoming the standard** in modern React development.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ When to Use Each Type of Component
**‚úÖ Use Functional Components when:**

- The component *does not need state* (static content).
- The component only *renders based on props*.
- 
**‚úÖ Use Class Components when:**

- The component *needs to manage its own state*.
- There is *complex logic that requires lifecycle methods*.
- 
**‚úÖ Use Hooks (Functional + State) when:**

- You want the *simplicity of functional components* but *need interactivity*.
- You want to avoid the complexity of *class components* (e.g., constructors, this.state).

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps
- Write a functional component from scratch.
- Learn more about how props work in upcoming lessons.
- Later, transition to using hooks for stateful behavior.

# Creating a Functional Component in React - Notes & Instructions

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Recap of Previous Lesson

- Learned about stateless functional components and stateful class components.
- Functional components can become stateful using React hooks.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up Your Workspace
- ‚úÖ Prerequisites:

- - Ensure you have a React app set up (my-app folder).
- - Open your workspace in VS Code.
- - Start the server:
```sh
cd my-app
npm start
```
- Live reloading should work, but if not, refresh the browser manually.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Functional Component from Scratch
üìå Follow these steps:

**Step 1: Create a New Component File**
- 1. Inside the src/ directory, create a new folder:
`components/`

- 2. Inside components/, create a new file:
`FunctionalGreeting.js`

**Step 2: Write a Basic Functional Component**
- 1. Open FunctionalGreeting.js.
- 2. Add this code:
```js

import React from "react";

function FunctionalGreeting() {
  return <h1>Hello from React!</h1>;
}

export default FunctionalGreeting;
```

**‚úÖ Explanation:**

- import React from "react"; ‚Üí Gives access to React functions.
- Function returns JSX (<h1>Hello from React!</h1>) ‚Üí This is the UI output.
- export default FunctionalGreeting; ‚Üí Makes it available for import in other files.

**Step 3: Import & Use the Component in App.js**
- 1. Open src/App.js.
- 2. Import the FunctionalGreeting component:
```js

import FunctionalGreeting from "./components/FunctionalGreeting";
```

- 3. Replace the existing <h1> with your new component:
``` js
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FunctionalGreeting />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

- 4. Save the file ‚Üí React automatically updates the browser.
  
**‚úÖ Why Self-Closing?**

- Since FunctionalGreeting does not wrap other components, it can be self-closed like:
```js
<FunctionalGreeting />
```
- If it wrapped content, you would write:
```js

<FunctionalGreeting>Content here</FunctionalGreeting>
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Converting to an Arrow Function (Modern Approach)
üìå Refactor FunctionalGreeting.js into an arrow function:

```js
import React from "react";

const FunctionalGreeting = () => <h1>Hello from React!</h1>;

export default FunctionalGreeting;
```

**‚úÖ Arrow Function Benefits:**

- Less code, cleaner syntax.
- No need for the return statement if it's a single-line function.
- You can use either method, but arrow functions are preferred in modern React.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding export default
- Why use export default?

- - Allows you to import the component with any name.
- - Example:
```js

import Greeting from "./components/FunctionalGreeting";
```
- - Though renaming is possible, it's best practice to keep the original component name.
- Named exports (export { ComponentName }) exist but will be covered in more advanced lessons.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways
‚úÖ Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX.
‚úÖ They are reusable and independent.
‚úÖ Must be exported and imported to be used in other files.
‚úÖ Arrow functions offer a cleaner syntax but are optional.
‚úÖ This is a stateless functional component‚Äîit does not change dynamically.

# Using Props in Functional Components - Notes & Instructions

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Recap of the Previous Lesson
- Created a basic functional component (FunctionalGreeting.js).
- Learned how to export, import, and render components.
- Components currently display static content.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why Use Props?
- Props (short for properties) allow components to become dynamic.
- They work like attributes in HTML but are fully customizable.
- Instead of rendering the same greeting every time, we can pass different values to the component.
- **Props are Parameters you pass into your React component in order to tell it what to render, and how.** 

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up a Component with Props

**Step 1: Create a New Component**
üìå Duplicate the existing component and rename it:

1. Copy FunctionalGreeting.js
2. Rename it to FunctionalGreetingWithProps.js.
3. Change the function and export statement inside it:
4. 
```js
import React from "react";

function FunctionalGreetingWithProps() {
  return <h1>Hello!</h1>;
}

export default FunctionalGreetingWithProps;
```

**Step 2: Import & Use the Component in App.js**

1. Open App.js and import the new component:
```js

import FunctionalGreetingWithProps from "./components/FunctionalGreetingWithProps";
```

2. Render the new component below the original one:
```js

<FunctionalGreetingWithProps />
```

3. Save the file ‚Üí Check if both components render in the browser.
4. 
‚úÖ At this stage, the new component is still static.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Adding & Using Props in a Component
**Step 1: Pass Props to the Component in App.js**
- Modify the component tag to pass a prop:

```js

<FunctionalGreetingWithProps greeting="Nice to meet you!" />
```
‚úÖ Now the component receives a greeting prop, but it won‚Äôt display it yet.

**Step 2: Retrieve & Use Props in the Component**
1. Open FunctionalGreetingWithProps.js.
2. Modify the function to accept props as a parameter:
```js

function FunctionalGreetingWithProps(props) {
  return <h1>{props.greeting}</h1>;
}
```
3. Save the file ‚Üí The browser should now display:
```css
Nice to meet you!
```
‚úÖ The component now dynamically displays different text based on props.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Multiple Props
1. Modify App.js to pass more props:
```js
<FunctionalGreetingWithProps greeting="Nice to meet you!" name="Alex" age={25} />
```
2. Modify FunctionalGreetingWithProps.js to display all props:
```js

function FunctionalGreetingWithProps(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.greeting}</h1>
      <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
3. Save the file ‚Üí Now the browser should display:
```vbnet

Nice to meet you!
Name: Alex
Age: 25
```
‚úÖ You can now pass and display multiple props dynamically.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding How Props Work
- Props are passed like HTML attributes:
```js
<ComponentName propName="value" />
```

- Props are received as an object (props) inside the component.
- Use curly braces ({}) to display props in JSX:
```js
<h1>{props.greeting}</h1>
```
‚úÖ Props allow the same component to display different content depending on the values passed in.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Challenge: Convert to an Arrow Function
- Try refactoring FunctionalGreetingWithProps.js to use an arrow function:
```js

const FunctionalGreetingWithProps = (props) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{props.greeting}</h1>
    <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
    <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
  </div>
);

export default FunctionalGreetingWithProps;
```
‚úÖ This achieves the same result but with cleaner syntax.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways
‚úÖ Props make functional components dynamic.
‚úÖ Props are passed like HTML attributes and accessed via props in the component.
‚úÖ Use curly braces ({}) to display prop values inside JSX.
‚úÖ Multiple props can be passed and used together.
‚úÖ Arrow functions offer a shorter syntax but are optional.
